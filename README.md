### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- access sports API for NBA to utilize up-to-date odds for the user.
- Render all the bets for that day in the body of the website
- Allow user to click on bet and append to the "betslip"

#### PostMVP  

- Apply the MVPs above to NFL, NCAA Basketball, and NHL Hockey
- Create "placing your bet" animation for when a bet is placed before it hits the "betslip".
- Create a landing page for users to sign up and display promotional content.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.  

```
// within the function to append the teams playing and start times in the far left column, I had to solve how to edit the "game.commence_time" endpoint to have the look of a normal date and time. It's orginal format was iso8601.

//...

    let gameData = ` 
    <div class="game-spacing">
      <div>${game.teams[1]}</div>
    </div>

    <div class="game-spacing">
      <div>${game.teams[0]}<br><span class="start-text">${fixTime(game.commence_time)}</span></div>
    </div>
    `
    gameContainer.appendChild(newGame)
    newGame.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', gameData)
  }) //declaring a variable (gameData) for the actual API data that i need for each game and creating HTML elements from them and appending them to the game container. 
}

let fixTime = (isoDate) => {
  let localDate = new Date(isoDate)
  let dateString = localDate.toString()
  let dateFormat = `${dateString.slice(0, 10)}`
  let timeFormat = ` ${dateString.slice(16, 21)}PM`

  return dateFormat + timeFormat
}
}
```

## Change Log
 There was no need to keep "remove API data" or "render other API content" in my timeframes as I was instructed to stop working and not try to accomplish my post MVP goal to display the data for football, college basketball, and hockey.

 Also, I had to adjust the odds data as it came in a decimal format and i needed it to display the +/- larger numbers. I added this in next to the adjusting the time.
